        <h2>A tribute: <b>The Spice Girls</b> </h2>

        <p>
            Some history/bio: The Spice Girls consist of 5 members: Scary (Mel B), Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Sporty (Mel C), and Posh (Victoria Beckham). 
            The band originated from the UK and all members are native to the UK. 
            The girls formed in 1994 and eventually signed to Virgin Records. From then, their success lead to a multi-million dollar
            merchandise industry and set the tone for the pop music genre for the remainder of the decade.
            Why do I admire the Spice Girls? Because they remind me of some of the best times of my life! They are a symbol of the 90s.
